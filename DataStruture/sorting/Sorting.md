# Sorting Algorithms 
Sorting -> Arranging element in particular order either in ascending or descending 

Classification
1.Comparison
2.Swapping or inversion count
3.Space /in-place 
4.recursive or iterative
5.Stability
6.Time complexity


### Bubble sort
- Compare the two elements if first elements is greater than second element then swap it.
- Once iterate the with swapping you will find the last element as highest value
- iteration - n+(n-1)+(n-2)+.. -> sum of natural number
- formula n*(n+1)/2
- Time complexity O(n^2)
- Space complexity O(1)
