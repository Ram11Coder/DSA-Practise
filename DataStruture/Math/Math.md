### Modular arithmetic

The remainder obtained after the division operation on two operands in knowns modular operation

if N then cycle will be 0 - N-1
example N=5 then 0-4 is a possible cycle


Modulo uses various competitive programming scenerios
1.Find the last digit of number
2.Palindrome
3.Armstrong
4.Integeroverflow


some times we dea with numbers which is larger than long, go with modulo operations
CP uses 

10^9+7 -> it is integer , prime ,first 10 digit
why this number?
repetetion is less 


### Distributive properties
-----------------------
(a+b)%m = ((a%m)+(b%m))%m
(a-b)%m = ((a%m)-(b%m))%m
(a*b)%m = ((a%m)*(b%m))%m
